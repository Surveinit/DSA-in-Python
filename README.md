## Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository
First, let me introduce myself. I am a lazy person whose full-time hobby is to dream big, but I can't work on them because of my laziness. If a lazy but ambitious person can do it, why can't you?

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository is dedicated to providing learning resources and implementations for fundamental data structures and algorithms concepts.

  

**ðŸŒ±Overview**

In this repository, you will find:
Detailed explanations and implementations of singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, stacks, and queues.

Code examples in Python for each data structure, along with explanations and comments to aid understanding.

Visual representations of data structures to help visualize how they work.

**ðŸ“‹Contents**

The repository currently includes the following data structures:

  

1. Linked Lists:

	A. Singly Linked List

	B. Doubly Linked List

2. Stacks: Implementation of a stack data structure

3. Queues: Implementation of a queue data structure

Each data structure comes with code examples, explanations, and visualizations to facilitate learning.

  

**ðŸŽ‰Getting Started**

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

 

    git clone https://github.com/Surveinit/DSA-in-Python.git

Then, explore the different directories for explanations, code examples, and visualizations. You can also contribute to the repository by adding new data structures or algorithms as you learn. As I continue to learn, I will regularly update this repository with new content and explanations.
